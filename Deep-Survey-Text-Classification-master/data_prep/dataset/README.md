# Dataset

The data used for evaluating all the models are taken from an active competition [Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment) launched by Kaggle along with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). This has been accepted by the NIPS 2017 Competition Track, because they need data scientists to help take personalized medicine to its full potential. Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). Currently, this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. For this competition MSKCC is making available an expert-annotated knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations. One needs to develop Machine Learning algorithms that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
