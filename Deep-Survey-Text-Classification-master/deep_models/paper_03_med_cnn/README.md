# [Medical Text Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06841)

Hughes et al (2017) [16] presented an approach to classify clinical text at sentence level. The model presented here is very similar to a normal CNN approach. But multiple configuration of stacked convolutional layers are used. The model ends with a fully connected layer followed by a softmax layer.

The model is tested with various hyper parameter optimization strategies mentioned in the paper. The model is implemented using just Tensorflow Apis.
